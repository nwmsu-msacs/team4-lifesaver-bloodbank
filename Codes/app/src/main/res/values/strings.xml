<p><b><font color="#A90113">A Blood Donor â€“ A Life Saver</font></b></p>
<font color="#000000">A few minutes of your time can save a person and extend his/her life by years. Become a blood donor and become a life saver. And your contribution by being a blood donor is not limited to saving just one patient but more than one. There are four unique components in blood which can be extracted and that can be used to help any patient in need of the corresponding component. So, by donating blood, always keep in mind that you are saving more than one life!</font><br>
<font color="#000000">For those of you who do not know this yet, any healthy individual can donate blood every three to six months. The human body has the ability to reproduce the lost blood without affecting the functioning of the body at all. Think about the number of lives you can save if you are regular blood donor. You can donate individual components of blood as well. Many patients may require individual components such as platelets, red blood cells, or plasma for their treatment. </font><br>
<font color="#000000">So, we request you all to become a part of the blood donating community and help save a number of lives. </font>]]> </Data></string>

        <item>Check with your local blood bank to determine the exact requirements, but generally, you must be at least 16 years of age, a minimum of 110 pounds, and in basic good health.</item>
        <item>You may feel a slight sting in the beginning lasting only a couple of seconds, but there should be no discomfort during the donation.</item>
        <item>No. Blood collected for transfusion in the US is given by volunteer blood donors.</item>
        <item>Blood supplies can vary depending on the region and time of year. As donor qualifications continue to become stricter and as the donor population ages, our nation is at risk of a low blood supply. If you are eligible, your blood donations are needed.</item>
        <item>Most blood centers strive to maintain an optimum inventory level of a three-day supply. Due to unpredictable demands from trauma incidents the inventory fluctuates hourly. When the blood supply drops below a three-day level, blood centers begin alerting local donors to increase the inventory to a safe operating level.</item>
        <item>No. There is no risk of contracting AIDS or any other disease through the donation process. Each collection kit is sterile, pre-packaged and used only once.</item>
        <item>Yes. The body contains 10 to 12 pints of blood. Your whole blood donation is approximately one pint.</item>
        <item>For a whole blood donation, approximately one pint (which weighs about one pound) is collected. For a platelet donation, the amount collected depends on your height, weight and platelet count.</item>
        <item>Not long at all. The volume of fluids will adjust within a few hours of your donation. The red blood cells will be replaced within a few weeks.</item>

    <string name="faqs"><Data><![CDATA[
    <p><b><font color="#A90113">1. What are the different types of blood groups?</font></b> <br>
    <font color="#000000">There are basically four types of blood groups. They are A, B, AB, and O. These are further classified into A+, A-, B+, B-, AB+, AB-, O+, and O-. The classification of the blood groups is based on the type of antigens (A or B or both or neither) present in the blood. The negative or positive sign beside the main blood group type signifies the absence or presence of Rh factor.</p></font><br>
    <p><b><font color="#A90113">2. What is Universal Acceptor and Universal Donor?</font></b> <br>
   <font color="#000000">Individuals with blood group AB+ are considered Universal Acceptors as they can receive blood from persons with any of the four blood groups. But their blood can be donated to only the persons with the same i.e. AB+ blood group.<br></font>
  <font color="#000000"> Individuals with blood group O- are considered Universal Donors as they donate blood to persons of any blood group type. But they can receive blood only from persons with the same blood group type i.e. O-.<br></font></p>
    <p><b><font color="#A90113">3. Which Blood Group is most common and which one is rare in India?</font></b> <br>
    <font color="#000000">Among the four main blood groups, B group is the most common type closely followed by O group while AB is the least common blood group. There is one more blood group known as Bombay Blood group or HH group which is extremely rare and is not considered among the major blood group types. Individuals with this group can accept or donate the blood from or to the individuals of the same group.</font>
